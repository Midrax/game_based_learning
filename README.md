# Game Based Learning

My thesis project, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for my BSc in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.

The concept for the game itself is quite simple, and takes heavy inspiration from games such as Buzz!, a quiz game where the player, facing other players, has to answer as fast and correctly as he can in order to win. In the games made with our editor, the Quiz Battles, the player faces a singular opponent, an AI with different degrees of difficulty, expressed in terms of probability to answer correctly, and a time slot within which the enemy player can answer randomly given the total number of seconds required to answer (established by whoever made the game). The higher the difficulty, the faster will the enemy answer, and the more chances will it have to answer correctly.
